## **Project Overview**
Crop yield forecasting is a crucial task for optimizing agricultural productivity and resource allocation. This project combines KNIME's visual workflow capabilities with Python's data science tools to:
- Preprocess raw datasets, including weather, soil, and yield data.
- Engineer features and create predictive models.
- Provide interpretable insights for stakeholders via dashboards and visualizations.

## **Workflow Description**

### **1. Data Preparation Phase**
- Collect and organize district-wise crop yield data.
- Integrate weather parameters: temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity.
- Preprocess soil condition data and unify datasets for analysis.

### **2. KNIME Workflow Development**
- **Step 1: Data Import and Preprocessing**:
  - Use File Reader nodes to load datasets.
  - Handle missing values, normalize data, and filter necessary columns.
- **Step 2: Feature Engineering**:
  - Create derived weather indices and time-based features.
- **Step 3: Model Development**:
  - Train models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression.
  - Use ensemble techniques for better predictions.
- **Step 4: Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate using performance metrics (MSE, RÂ²) and cross-validation.
- **Step 5: Deployment**:
  - Generate REST API endpoints and dashboards for real-time use.

### **3. Validation and Testing**
- Validate models against historical data.
- Compare results with existing statistical methods.
- Perform sensitivity analysis.
